# Link Page <!-- omit in toc -->

WIP app to create a link page for social media profiles, Homepage, GitHub, etc.
The use-case that prompted this is to have a changing target for a static link
in a QR code on a business card.

It's also an example of using FastAPI with Jinja2 templates. This allows having
a simple web site, but still able to access config files, databases and API's.
